In additively manufactured material, fatigue life is significantly affected by manufacturing defects such as gas pores and lack of fusions. This code can extract essential features such as sphericity, minimum distance from the surface, volume, surface area, and equivalent diameter from the two separate high-quality STL files. One STL file only has all the pores and lack of fusion built from the CT scan images using threshold segmentation. And another STL only has the sample without any pores.
